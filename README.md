# DengAI: Predicting Dengue Fever Spread

This is my solution for the DengAI challenge posted on DrivenData.org. 

You can find the challenge here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

I have achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.31 using the Support Vector Regression model, placing me in the better midfield of submissions (as of June, 2019) despite a minimal time investment to try this myself.
