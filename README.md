# DengAI: Predicting Dengue Fever Spread

This is my solution of the DengAI challenge, which was hosted on DrivenData.org. 

You can find the description and the data here: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/

I have achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.31 using Support Vector Regression. 

For comparison I also deployed a simple sequential neural network, which after some tweaking achieved a MAE of 13.17 - slightly outperforming the SVR.
